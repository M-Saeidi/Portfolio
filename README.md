## Project 1: Deep learning application for fault detection and condition monitoring in wind farms
Implementation of Correlation Analysis, Feature Selection, and Preprocessing techniques on mechanical and electrical wind farm datasets.
Developing Multiple Linear Regression and Recurrent Neural Networks (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) using Keras package for Fault Detection and condition monitoring.

## Project 2: Classification of users based on their social network advertisement purchases
Developing KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classification Methods using scikit-learn library for advertisement effectiveness on social media users.

## Project 3: Deep learning application for image classification
In this project, a model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed by using different packages in Keras library to distinguish different types of a dataset with more than 10k images.
