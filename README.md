## [Project 2: Classification of users based on their social network advertisement purchases](https://github.com/M-Saeidi/Classification-of-users-based-on-their-social-network-advertisement-purchases)
Developing K-Nearest Neighborss (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest classification Methods using scikit-learn library for advertisement effectiveness on social media users based on their age and salary.

## [Project 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application for image classification](https://github.com/M-Saeidi/CNN-for-Image-Claasification)
In this project, a model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed by using different packages in Keras library to distinguish different types of image dataset with more than 10k images.

## Project 4: Geo-demographic analysis of churn rate for a financial instution using Artificial Neural Networks
In this project, a financial institution asked us as a Data Scientist to find the most vulnerable client which will probably cancel their subscription. In this practical classification problem, the financial institution provided us with more than 10K clients information such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, possession of credit card, estimated salary, and etc. For this purpose, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, and OneHotEncoder classes are used to handle the categorical input features. Moreover, a multi-layer ANN model is developed using Keras library to create an accurate classifier for detection of clients which are more likely to cancel their subscription.

## Project 5: Recurrent Neural Network application for Google stock price prediction
In this project, the Google stock prices for the first month of 2017 is predicted using the Google stock prices from 2012 to 2016 as the training dataset. In this project, the MinMaxScaler class is used to preprocess the dataset. For obtaining the stock price values in this time-series problem, Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with Dropout technique is developed and Mean Square Error (MSE) is exploited to show the proper performance of model in predicting the testset.
